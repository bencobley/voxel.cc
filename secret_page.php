                <div class="row">
                    <p>The idea for this business was motivated by a desire to solve a problem that affected us personally as makers. It was now time to explore whether the same problems are faced by other people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="col-sm">
                        <b>Key objectives:</b>
                        <br>
                        <p>To understand what being a ‘maker’ really means, understand who this product applies to, and develop personas that will enable us to meet user needs. </p>
                        <br>
                        <b>Activities:</b>
                        <br>
                        <p>We are fortunate to be part of a community of maker-minded people at Imperial; in the Design Engineering Department and at the Advanced Hackspace. We also spoke to parents in the Department, friends and family, and educators in making. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In total 20+ hours of qualitative <a style="color: blue;" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6KoAXBtrIV0qBu7Vs1T4wgZgos4d34oR-uLv1ILZToXfi-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">long-format user interviews</a> were undertaken with participants of all ages, and a range of experience in making and smart homes. We appreciated that the diversity of backgrounds of interviewees was limited, however this provided a good start. </p>

                        <b>Results:</b>
                        <br>
                        <p>We were surprised to find that our target user group ‘makers’ was really four distinct segments. The feedback was highly valuable in showing that interest in the product was motivated by various different needs. Personas were developed to capture these segments.</p>

                        <p>The product was conceived with the mission of giving to the crazy inventors, smart home wizards and new makers the tools and flexibility to create whatever they want.

                        <p> The prototype demonstrated that the technical challenge of assembling a diverse range of modules into a modularised system was possible. The internal components are fundamentally simple, the next challenge was to package them in such a way that communicates the added value of a modular system.</p>

                        <p> We realised that while the LED matrix fully matched the block dimensions, the sensors’ circuit was considerably smaller. To optimise space and reduce costs, the sensors’ embodiment was reimagined into a flat tile-shaped module.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This website was designed to be a tool for validating whether our idea is attractive to potential customers. This was an exciting opportunity to finally expand our user testing outside London and the UK, and outside our circles. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It can be targeted to the real audience through selectively posting material in related forums.</li>
                    <li>It is realistic: customers will find the website through communities, forum posts and videos, just like customer acquisition in the final product.</li>
                    <li>Design for manufacturing</li>
                    <li>It is quantifiable: customer interest can be tracked by their journey through the site. Customers do not know they are being surveyed (unlike an interview), so act normally</li>

                            <p>Awesome prototype and concept! I'm constantly thinking that I would love in my lounge a simple setup that shows time, weather, tides, today's calendar, a pre-defined list of music playlists and some basic light control. There may be some creativity required for things that require more textual detail (i.e. calendar) but I like the low-res vibe for everything else.</p>

                            <p>The best feature is probably that it integrates with those other platforms. I think integration is probably the key to success in this field. Home automation and IoT in general are just starting to get past the stage where personal computers were in the mid-80s, when we had Apple, IBM, Commodore, Amiga and a host of others, each in its own silo.</p>
